# Rolimon's Ad Bot - Automatically create trade ads easily

By <b>Idyvist</b> | [My Roblox Profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/111211330/profile)

## Description
  This bot will automatically post ads on Rolimon's every 20 minutes with your <b>highest</b> items that are <b>not</b> on hold. The code is open-source and you are free to modify this as you wish. Feel free to add me on Discord (idyvist) if you need any help.

## How to Use
* Step 1
  * If you don't have it installed already, install [Python](https://www.python.org) from this link
* Step 2
  * Press the green "Code" button, then press "Download ZIP", then extract the contents into a folder.
* Step 3
  * Install the [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) extension.
* Step 4
  * Go to [rolimons.com](https://www.rolimons.com), and use EditThisCookie to copy the `_RoliData` and `_RoliVerification` cookies.
* Step 5
  * Edit your `config.json` file, and paste in your cookies. Also paste in your Roblox User ID.
* Step 6
  * Go to Command Prompt, and paste in `pip install requests configparser`. If you can't use this command for some reason, rerun your Python installer and make sure the box `Add Python to PATH` and `pip` is checked.
* Step 7
  * Run the `main.py` file, and it should start automatically posting ads!
